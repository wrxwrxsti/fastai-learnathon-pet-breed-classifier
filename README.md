# 🐶 FastAI Learnathon – Pet Breed Classifier

This is my submission for the [FastAI Learnathon](https://course.fast.ai) — a 2-day async sprint to build your first real deep learning model.

## 📌 What This Does

This notebook trains a computer vision model using FastAI and the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset. The goal: predict the breed of a pet (dog or cat) from an image.

Built and trained with:
- ✅ FastAI’s `cnn_learner`
- ✅ Transfer learning with `resnet34` and `resnet50`
- ✅ Model fine-tuning with learning rate optimization
- ✅ Inference on new images
- ✅ Full training pipeline run on Google Colab

## 📁 Files

- `pet_breed_model.ipynb`: the full training notebook
- `pet_breeds_model.pkl`: the exported model (can be loaded for inference)

## 🚀 How to Run

You can open and run the notebook in Google Colab:
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/YOUR_USERNAME/fastai-learnathon-pet-breed-classifier/blob/main/pet_breed_model.ipynb)

Make sure to set the runtime to **GPU** for faster training.

## 💡 What I Learned

- End-to-end deep learning workflow using FastAI
- How to debug notebook errors and skip unnecessary code blocks
- The power of building quickly by doing

## 🧠 Model Accuracy

The final model achieved strong validation accuracy with minimal fine-tuning, showcasing FastAI's power for rapid prototyping.
